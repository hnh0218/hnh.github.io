        </div>
            <p>
                The Smart Apartment Complex was designed with a aim for increasing the awareness for envrionment and energy conservation. 
                Under this purpose, each members of  10th grade devised the related facilities including automatic car/gate, microbit dust sensor, and LED city lights. 
                These are all created through the inference of microbit and coding process that we have learned throughout the ET class.
                Also, we followed the engineering design process while we progress this project.

                <h4>ASK</h4>

                <h4>IMAGINE</h4>
                <p>Modeling the apartment complex would be the most direct way of showing paradigm regarding this issue; the actual visualization through the city model would be effective in terms of increasing awareness. </p>

                        <li>The microbit dust sensor detects the dust level when the stimulus go pass through the sensor hole.</li>
                        <li>Responding to the dust level, the microbit changes its emoji between SKULL and SMILE face.</li>
                        <li>It appears SMILE with the mild dust level, while turns to SKULL if the dust level exceed the set threshold.</li>
                        <li>Simultaneously, the OLED pannel reflects the exact number of dust level for accuracy.</li>

                <p>I validified the function of the dust sensor through actuall simulation.</p>

                    <li>Whether the dust sensor/OLED pannels work based on the code that I made?</li>
                    <li>Whether 3D printed structure stably support the overall arrangement of the dust sensor?</li>

                <h5>IT WOULD BE BETTER WHAT IF...</h5>
                <p>The dust sensor has the LED device that informs the dust level more conspicuously</p>
                <p>The dust sensor becomes more advanced, hence being able to inform beyond the simple dust level,
                    such as providing recommendation of needed commodities for that day(ex.mask).
